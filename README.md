# WhereAmI-FindWhereYouAre-Geocoder-LocationProvider
 Find where you are (city,state,coordinates, country)
With the usage of Location Provider I get the users longitude and latitude values.
With the GeoCoder I show users "Where they are"
This practice project aimed to learn using location services.
